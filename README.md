Building a MERN Stack CRUD Web Application with Tailwind CSS 

Overview

Full-stack CRUD web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling. The project includes authentication, authorization, and various frontend and backend dependencies to facilitate development.

CRUD System

1. Understanding CRUD
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that can be performed on data. In a web application, these operations typically correspond to:

Create: Adding new data(user) or records to the system .

Read: Retrieving and displaying existing data(user) .

Update: Modifying existing data(user) .

Delete: Removing data(user)  from the system.

Backend Development
2. Setting Up the Backend
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.

Mongoose: Facilitates MongoDB object modeling in Node.js.

3. Authentication and Authorization
bcryptjs: Hashes passwords for enhanced security.

jsonwebtoken: Implements JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.

User Roles: Implement different user roles to control access to different functionalities. Roles can include "admin," "user," etc.

4. Middleware for HTTP Requests
cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies.

5. Database
MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database.

6. Email Sending
nodemailer: Allows sending emails, e.g., for password reset.

7. Utilities
date-fns: A modern JavaScript date utility library.

uuid: Generates unique identifiers.

Frontend Development
8. Setting Up the Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router: Declarative routing for React.js.

9. UI Components and Styling
Material-UI: Pre-built React components following Material Design principles.

FontAwesome: SVG icon library.

react-icons: SVG icons for popular icon libraries.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

10. HTTP Requests
axios: An HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
